1. To delete a student, find the student you would like to delete, and then click the "x" next to their name

4. To edit a student, click the pencil icon next to the student's name. The form you are taken to should pre-fill with the current student information. Click "Edit student" to submit.

6. To add a student, click the "+" on the [Students page](http://localhost:1337/students), next to the word "students". Fill out all information and hit "Add Student".

#### Campus Element

2. To delete a campus, click the "x" next to the campus name. Note that deleting a campus will cascade, deleting all students from that campus.

3. To edit a campus, click the pencil icon next to the campus name. The form you are taken to should pre-fill with the current campus information. Click "Edit Campus" to submit.

5. To add a campus, click the "+" on the [Campuses page](http://localhost:1337/campuses), next to the word "Campuses". Fill out all information and hit "Add Campus".


## Known bugs
- if you put an invalid url into the image field when editing or updating a campus, it will fail more-or-less silently (The console will log a 500 error but there is no obvious indication to the user that the request has failed).
